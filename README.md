# Real-Time-Process-Synchronization-Analyzer
Real-Time Process Synchronization Analyzer visualizes and analyzes how multiple processes access shared resources in real time. It simulates mutexes, semaphores, and synchronization algorithms to detect race conditions, deadlocks, and performance issues, helping users understand OS process coordination effectively.
